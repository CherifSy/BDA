### Initial Project

#### Structure-Property Linkage of Randomly Packed Mono-sized Structures

Our Initial project only considered mono-sized structures, and we tried to use Lattice-Boltzmann method to numerically quantify permeability of the structures. Details of this project description can be found in our first post [_Project Progress I post_](http://mahdi-roozbahani.github.io/MIC-Packed-Particles/2014/09/17/Project-Description.html).
