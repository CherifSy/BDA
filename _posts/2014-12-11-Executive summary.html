### Motivation and Objective
Soil structure is the study object of interest for this project, which is related to our own research. And hydraulic conductivtiy, a key transport propert of soils, is the property of interest. 

Hydraulic conductivity describes the ease with which the fluid can move through pore spaces. To quantify this property, experimental tests are cost expensive and difficult to conduct. Additionally, due to the complex nature of soils, available empirical solutions have restricted applications. It cannot understand the impact of internal structure very well. Numerical simulations are very computational expensive. 

As such, our project objective is to develop a fast, rigorous approach to quantify hydraulic conductivity of packed soil particles based on acquiring thorough microstructural information.

### Challenges and Trials

#### What packed soil particles samples should we work on?

Our Initial idea only considered randomly packed mono-sized structures, but it cannot reflect the complex nature of soils and would lead to a very restricted application of the project results. It is neccesary for us to consider soil particles with different sizes and different shapes. 

Accordingly, we take four different packed soil structures into account: Mono-sized, binary-sized and multi-sized samples genereated by Gravitational Sphere Packing Simulation (GSP) and one real soil sample reconstructed from 2D optical microscopic images. After obtaining the soil structures to be examined, we randomly sampled a total of 703 subvolumes as our fully datasets.

#### How to obtain hydraulic conductivity data?

Lack of experimental data for hydraulic conductivity, so we need to acquire the data using numerical method. At the beginning, we tried to use Lattice-Boltzmann method, a relatively new and advanced simulation technique for complex fluid systems. Details of this project description can be found in our first post [_Project Progress I post_](http://mahdi-roozbahani.github.io/MIC-Packed-Particles/2014/09/17/Project-Description.html).

Based on this plan, we spent about one month struggling with the LBM simulation since neither of us had the experience in this simulation. We obtained the code from the website and modifed it to meet our requirement, but we had the problem on the unit conversion (lattice units to physical units). Details of the progresses for LBM simulation can be found in our posts [_Project Progress II_](http://mahdi-roozbahani.github.io/MIC-Packed-Particles/2014/10/01/Project-Progress.html) and [_Unit Conversion from Lattice Units to Physical Units_](http://mahdi-roozbahani.github.io/MIC-Packed-Particles/2014/10/22/Project-Progress-3.html).

Then we tried FEM program [_COMSOL Multiphysics_](http://www.comsol.com), which was suggested by one classmate, to calculate permeability. We spent one week on this trial, but still couldn't acquire useful results. The problem was that when structure geometry was imported to COMSOL, the mesh creating errors always occurred. 

At the end, with the help of Ahmet, we figured out a way to numerically calculate hydraulic conductivity using [_Finite Volume Method_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method). It is on the basis of incompressible single-phase flow move through porous media.
