## Trial for Numerical computation of Permeability---Lattice Boltzmann Method 

## Background
* [Lattice Boltzmann method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods) is a relatively new simulation technique for complex fluid systems.the discrete Boltzmann equation is solved to simulate the flow of a Newtonian fluid with collision models.
