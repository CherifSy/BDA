## Trial for Numerical computation of Permeability---Lattice Boltzmann Method 

## Background
* [Lattice Boltzmann method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods) is a relatively new simulation technique for complex fluid systems. The discrete Boltzmann equation is solved to simulate the flow of a Newtonian fluid with collision models.
* Permeability (Hydraulic Conductivity) is the property of interest. 
* If we can come up with the numerical results for permeability, we can do two parts of work: 
  (1) correlate 2-point statistics to permeability through PCA and regression analyses
  (2) correlate structure properties to permeability (propose new equation).
