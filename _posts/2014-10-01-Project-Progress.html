## Trial for Numerical computation of Permeability---Lattice Boltzmann Method 

### Background
* [Lattice Boltzmann method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods) is a relatively new simulation technique for complex fluid systems. The discrete Boltzmann equation is solved to simulate the flow of a Newtonian fluid with collision models.
* Permeability (Hydraulic Conductivity) is the property of interest. 
* If we can come up with the numerical results for permeability, we can do two parts of work: 
  (1) correlate 2-point statistics to permeability through PCA and regression analyses
  (2) correlate structure properties to permeability (propose new equation).

### Progess 
* Generated randomly packed mono-sized structures ([Gravitational Sphere Packing Simulation](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W8oVUI8AAAAJ&hl=en))

* 3-D LBM simulation of flow through one selected volume (60*60*60 voxels)

* Quantified flow rate

### Next Steps
1. Sample 200 volumes from the microstructure to perform LBM simulation
2. Convert the lattice units to physical units to obtain permeability for each volume
3. 2-point spatial statistics
