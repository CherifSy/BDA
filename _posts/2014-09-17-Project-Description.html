## Microstructure-Property Relationship in Randomly Packed Mono-sized Structures

## Team Members
* Jie (Jessie) Cao - Civil and Environmental Engineering
* Mahdi Roozbahani - Computational Science and Engineering

## Project Goals
 Extract structure-property linkages in the mono-sized packed spherical particles
 
* Structure: mono-packed particles
* Property: Permeability


## Background
* Random Loose packed spherical particles is a common packed structure,which is frequently used in many fields such as powder    technology, soil mechanics, and material science, etc.
* Permability is a significant transport property of porous media. It can be computed either by the numerical simulation or empirical equations ([Kozny-Carman equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozeny%E2%80%93Carman_equation)).

## Source of Structure Datasets

 The packed structure will be simulated by the new Gravitational Sphere Packing Simulation. More information about this simulation can be found in [this link](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W8oVUI8AAAAJ&hl=en).

## Details of Structure Datasets

* Tortousity
* Porosity
* 2-point statistics

## Proposed Workflow

* Implement simulations based on the gravitational sphere packing approach

* If we can come up with the numerical results for permeability such as  Lattice-Boltzmann method, we can do two parts of work: 

  (1) correlate 2-point statistics to permeability through PCA and regression analyses

  (2) correlate structure properties to permeability (propose new equation)

* Compare two approaches: 2-point statistics-permeability and structure-permeability.
