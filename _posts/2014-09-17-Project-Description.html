## Project Goals

 Extract structure-property linkages in the mono-sized packed spherical particles
* Structure: mono-packed particles
* Property: Permeability


## Background
* Random Loose packed spherical particles is a common packed structure,which is frequently used in many fields such as powder    technology, soil mechanics, and material science, etc.
* Permability is a significant transport property of porous media. It can be computed either by the numerical simulation or empirical equations ([Kozny-Carman equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozeny%E2%80%93Carman_equation).

## Source of Structure Datasets

*  Gravitational Sphere Packing Simulation

 The packed structure will be simulated by the new Gravitational Sphere Packing Simulation. More information about this simulation can be found in [this link](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W8oVUI8AAAAJ&hl=en).

## Details of Structure Datasets

* Tortousity
* Porosity
* 2-point statistics

## Proposed Workflow

* Implement simulations based on the gravitational sphere packing approach
* If we can come up with the numerical results for permeability such as  Lattice-Boltzman method, we can correlate structure property and 2-point statistics to permeability   
* Discover the correlations between structure variance and property variance
