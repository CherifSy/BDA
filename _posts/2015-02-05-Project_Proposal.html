---
## Project Proposal

### Team Members
* Adam Johnson - Computer Science (GTID:   gt Email:)
* Mahdi Roozbahani - Computational Science and Engineering (GTID:902973169   gt Email:mahdir@gatech.edu)

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
(what you plan to do? why do that? how to do that? what differences will it makes?)


#### Kernel Methods
